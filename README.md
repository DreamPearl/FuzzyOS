# FuzzyOS
Experimental OS

- It's experimental. So it's safe to assume that the burn operation can be destructive.
- Use it at your own risk. 

#### Usage
- Fix constants in `scripts/run.sh`
  - Just a helpful script for sometime.
  - Point `${DISK}` to the disk file.
- Execute `scripts/run.sh` and for build and then burn.

##### Boot from Flash Drive
- It's might better to format drive with MBR with a FAT partition.
- Burn it with image.
